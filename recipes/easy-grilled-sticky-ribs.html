    <p>i'm showing you my favorite way to grill ribs, which of course, is not the same as barbecued ribs. Those are cooked low and slow in a smoker and served as-is, with BBQ sauce on the side. Whereas, these are cooked first, then sliced, and then each rib is glazed with our beautiful sticky sauce on the grill.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 racks baby back pork ribs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Glaze</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 120 degrees C</li>
        <li>Mix salt, sugar, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder for dry rub together in small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Line a large sheet pn with heavy-duty aluminium foil. Place rack of ribs on the prepared pan, bone side down. Poke all over with a sharp knife. Make shallow slits accross at an angle, and then repeat the opposite way; this allows the dry rub to penetrate. Coat on both sides with rub; flip back over, ensuring the bone side is down. Wrap tightly with foil.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the center of the preheated oven and bake for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 2 hours, up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat a charcoal grill until coals are very ashy and hot.</li>
        <li>Remove from the refrigerator, unwrap, and brush off excess fat. Slice between the bones to seperate each rib.</li>
        <li>Combine ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, and cayenne with a spoon in a bown for glaze</li>
        <li>Place ribs on the preheated grill and cook for 2 minutes; flip and brush over glaze. Flip and repeat process until ribs are as caramelized as you prefer, about 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Remove to a plate and brush over one more application of glaze. Serve</li>
    </ol>
